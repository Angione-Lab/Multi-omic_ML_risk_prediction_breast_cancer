# Integrating multi-omic machine learning with patient-specific metabolic modelling for personalised therapy in breast cancer

This is the code for the experiments for the framework integrating machine learning with patient-specific metabolic modelling to predict risk for breast cancer patients. There are 3 main folders in this github:
<li> Data preprocessing: providing the preprocessing code, including feature selection techniques for transcriptomic and fluxomic data; </li>
<li> Metabolic modelling: providing the code for GSMM to generate patient-specific flux rates (fluxomic data);</li>
<li> ML models: providing the code (in jupiter notebook) for the machine learning (ML) models. The code is reproducible with different number of selected omic features; hence, we provide the ML results for the optimal selected omic features for each data modality and their combinations.</li>

        
Data used in this study can be downloaded at TCGA website: https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/. We provide all data used in this study, including preprocessed clinical, raw transcriptomic, and fluxomic data generated by metabolic model (DOI:10.6084/m9.figshare.22337722).
